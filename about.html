    <p class="whatIsPosture">During quarantine, many students have been forced to take online classes, many workers have been forced to do work from home, and many people have no choice but to stay at home. These situations can be mentally and physically draining for all ages. Over the weeks, months, and now years, having good posture has become increasingly hard to maintain. Project Posture is dedicated to making sure people of all age groups are aware of how to maintain good posture, and how to improve it. </p>
